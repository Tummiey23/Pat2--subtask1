What is a Morse Code ?
Morse code is a system of communication that encodes text into sequences of dots (·) and dashes (−). These signals represent letters, numbers, and punctuation, and can be transmitted via sound, light, or electrical pulses.

 Historical Context of morse code 
 
- Developed in the 1830s–1840s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail
- Originally used to send messages over telegraph lines
- It revolutionized long-distance communication by allowing text to travel almost instantly across wires—a huge leap from letters carried by horse or train

How morse code was made 

Morse code emerged during the early development of the electric telegraph, a revolutionary invention that allowed for long-distance communication. Samuel Morse, an American artist and inventor, along with his associate Alfred Vail, created this coding system to facilitate the transmission of messages over telegraph wires. The first public demonstration of Morse's telegraph took place in 1844, where the famous message "What hath God wrought" was sent from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore, Maryland. 
Morse code was a groundbreaking invention that transformed how people communicated over distances, and its legacy continues in various forms today.

How do Morse Code Works?

Each character is represented by a unique pattern of dots and dashes:
- Dot (·) = short signal
- Dash (−) = long signal
  
Examples:
- A = ·−
- B = −···
- C = −·−·
- SOS (distress signal) = ···−−−···
Characters are separated by spaces, and words are separated by longer gaps. The timing between signals is crucial for clarity.

Morse code can be transmitted in various ways, including:

SOUND : Tapping out the code using a telegraph key or signaling with a whistle.
LIGHT : Flashing a light on and off to represent dots and dashes.
RADIO WAVES : Sending coded messages via radio signals, which is common in aviation and maritime communication.
